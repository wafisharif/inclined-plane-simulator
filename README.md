A physics simulator that models the motion of a block on a ramp with configurable angle, mass, and friction. Great for visualizing force vectors and Newtonâ€™s second law.

Features
- Adjustable ramp angle, object mass, and coefficient of friction
- Toggle for enabling/disabling friction
- Real-time force vectors and motion stats

How to Use
- Use the sliders to change mass, angle, and friction
- Enable/disable friction using the toggle
- Observe how the block responds to gravity and friction
